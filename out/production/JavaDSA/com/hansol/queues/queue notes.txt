Queues:

Queues are an abstract data type.
They enforce a "First in, First out" (FIFO).

Has methods:

    .add() - also called "enqueue". Adds item to END of queue.
    .remove() - also called "dequeue". Removes item from FRONT of queue.
    .peek() - get item at the front of the queue but doesn't remove it.

You can implement using arrays or LinkedLists.
You have two pointers. Front and back.
In a LinkedList, you just manipulate the pointers.
Complexity is the same as it was with stacks. It can be linear time if you need to resize an array and always
constant time when using LinkedLists.
