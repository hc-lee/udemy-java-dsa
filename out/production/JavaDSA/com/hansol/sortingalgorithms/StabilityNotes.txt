Stable vs Unstable sorting algorithms.

In an UNSTABLE sort, the relative positions of the elements of the array after sorting is NOT the same.
Consider the array: int[] arr = {5,9(1),3,9(2),8,4}

After sorting: {3,4,5,6,9(2),9(1)}

The second 9 is now before the first 9 in the original array.

A STABLE sort would have yielded: {3,4,5,6,9(1),9(2)}
For integers, it usually won't matter but for other it might.

-   Bubble Sort is a STABLE algorithm. Reason is because when
