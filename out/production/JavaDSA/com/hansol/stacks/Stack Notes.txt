Stacks follow a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure. An array or LinkedList can be used as a stack.

Three operations:

Push: Pushes a value/ref onto the stack.
Pop: Return top of stack into variable. Remove from stack.
Peek: Check value of top of stack without removing or popping.

All O(1) complexity. Ideal backing structure is a LinkedList. An array might need to be resized, an O(n) operation.
