Heap Sort:

In a MAX heap, we know the root has the largest value.

    * Swap root with last ELEMENT in ARRAY.
    * Heapify tree BUT exclude the last node.
    * After heapify, the second largest element is at the root.
    * Decrement last index.
    * Repeat until sorted.

After every iteration, the new max is moved to index[0] and the old max is placed at the end of the working array.
A heapsorted MAX heap will result in an ascending sort.
