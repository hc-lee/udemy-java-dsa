Lists and Abstract Data Types:

* A concrete data structure like an array dictates how the data needs to be organized. An array, for example, dictates
    that every element must be the same size and stored contiguously in memory. I.e. memory is pre-reserved for an
    array of size N of type WORD/DWORD/QWORD, etc...

* And abstract data type in comparison does not have these hard and fast rules about how the data is organized. However,
    it does dictate what operations you can perform on that data and describes the behavior of the structure.

* Concrete data structures are usually a concrete class. Abstract data types are typically an interface in Java
    (List<E>, ArrayList<E>, etc.).
