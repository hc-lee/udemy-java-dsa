Stacks are good because all operations (push, pop, peek, isEmpty) are all performed in O(1) constant time.
Stacks can be a useful structure when you are:
    1. Parsing:
        * Evaluating math expressions, (postfix <-> infix, etc.).
        * Brackets (isValidParentheses type questions)
        * Reversing the order of anything (i.e. strings). This is O(n) however.

    2. Also questions about stacks themselves:
        * Implement a stack using a queue.
        * Implement 2 stacks using a single array.
