Queues are a FIFO data structure that can:
    1. Enqueue (add to back of queue)
    2. Dequeue (remove from front of queue).
In O(1) time. This involves using TWO pointers (one for front and back) as opposed to the single pointer in stacks.

    1. Traversing a tree in LEVEL order.
    2. Traversing a graph in Breadth First Search (BFS)
